# cf-rally-sport-direct
This repository was created for an interview coding challenge with the following steps
>- Look over the code base and structure of this folder. Imagine this would be inside of the vendor folder from a composer project. 
>- There are several \\TODO  comments around the code. Take a moment to comment on what you think is going on there. 
>- In the app structure there is a Routes file, a Controller and a View.  For extra points attempt to make a  GET route, that points to a new controller that you make, to a method that displays a view you create. We know that is not a runnable environment so small typos are not going to be considered a negative. 
>- Please commit your updated version of this folder to your own Github repo and send the link to chris.french@rallysportdirect.com
